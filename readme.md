Placeholder fix
---------------

The placeholder attribute has been introduced in HTML5 specifications for input and textarea elements. The placeholder text is shown when the element is empty and not focused.  However, some browsers do not support this attribute.  This fix is a fallback until the placholder attribute is fully supported in *all* browsers.
